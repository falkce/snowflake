# User-Defined Tasks

## General Info
User-defined tasks allow scheduled execution of SQL statements. Tasks run according to a specified execution configuration, using any combination of a set interval and/or a flexible schedule using a subset of familiar cron utility syntax. Tasks currently run in user-specified warehouses but will eventually run in a serverless environment using Snowflake-supplied compute resources.
